The Pythonista URL Scheme
=========================

Pythonista can be launched from other applications with the custom ``pythonista://`` URL scheme.

.. note::
    In Pythonista 3.x, you can use ``pythonista3://`` instead of ``pythonista://``. In Pythonista 2 (starting with 2.1), you can use ``pythonista2://``. Use these schemes if you want to target a specific version of the app. In case both apps are installed, it is undefined which one of them handles a ``pythonista://`` URL.

Basics
------

* **Open the app:**
  
  Use ``pythonista://`` without any additional parameters
  to open the app without doing anything else.

* **Open a script for editing:**
  
  Use ``pythonista://MyScript`` for opening one of your scripts in the editor.
  The name of the script can contain the ``.py`` file extension, but it
  doesn't have to.

* **Run a script from your library:**
  
  Use ``pythonista://MyScript?action=run`` for
  running a script that is in your library. This only works if no script is
  already running when the app is started.

.. note::
    You can only open or run scripts that are `already in your library`.
    It is not possible to run arbitrary code or create new scripts using
    the URL scheme.

Command-line Arguments
----------------------

When using the ``action=run`` parameter (see above), you can pass command-line
arguments to the script in two ways:

* **Method 1: One args parameter**
  
  Example: ``pythonista://MyScript?action=run&args=foo%20bar``

  When you pass a single string with the `args` URL parameter, the string is
  split by spaces (the space is encoded as ``%20`` here) and :data:`sys.argv`
  would be ``[<script_path>, 'foo', 'bar']`` in this example.
  
  If you want to pass arguments that contain spaces, you have to enclose them
  in double quotes (as you would in a classic shell).
  
  This is basically the same as running a script by long-pressing the run
  button.

* **Method 2: Multiple argv parameters**
  
  Example: ``pythonista://MyScript?action=run&argv=foo&argv=bar``
  
  Using multiple arguments that are all named `argv`, you don't have to worry
  about quoting arguments that contain spaces. Each of the parameters
  corresponds to one element in :data:`sys.argv`.
   
  If the URL contains at least one `argv` parameter, `args` is ignored.

Python Version
--------------

Pythonista 3 supports two different Python interpreters: 2.7 and 3.5. If you want to use a specific interpreter for running a script, you can use the ``version=[2|3]`` or ``py=[2|3]`` parameter. This parameter is ignored in Pythonista 2 (which only supports Python 2.7).

If the ``version`` parameter is used, it overrides both the default interpreter setting and any shebang that might be defined in the script itself.

Launching Other Apps
--------------------

If you want to go in the opposite direction, and open an app `from Pythonista`,
you can do this with the :mod:`webbrowser` module.

For example, to open TweetBot, you could use the following code::

    import webbrowser
    webbrowser.open('tweetbot://')
