The ImageFilter Module
======================

.. module:: ImageFilter

The :mod:`ImageFilter` module contains definitions for a pre-defined set of filters, which can be be used with the filter method of the :class:`Image` class.

Example
-------
Filter an Image::

    import ImageFilter

    im1 = im.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)

    im2 = im.filter(ImageFilter.MinFilter(3))
    im3 = im.filter(ImageFilter.MinFilter) # same as MinFilter(3)

Filters
-------
The current version of the library provides the following set of predefined image enhancement filters:

BLUR, CONTOUR, DETAIL, EDGE_ENHANCE, EDGE_ENHANCE_MORE, EMBOSS, FIND_EDGES, SMOOTH, SMOOTH_MORE, and SHARPEN.

.. function:: Kernel(size, kernel, scale=None, offset=0)

    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a convolution kernel of the given size. In the current version, size must be either (3, 3) or (5, 5), and the kernel argument must be a sequence containing 9 or 25 integer or floating point weights.

    If scale is given, the result of applying the kernel to each pixel is divided by the scale value. The default is the sum of the kernel weights.

    If offset is given, this value is added to the result, after it has been divided by scale.

.. function:: RankFilter(size, rank)

    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a rank filter of the given size. For each pixel in the input image, the rank filter sorts all pixels in a (size, size) environment by pixel value, and copies the rankâ€˜th value to the output image.
    
.. function:: MinFilter(size=3)

    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a min filter of the given size. For each pixel in the input image, this filter copies the smallest pixel value from a (size, size) environment to the output image.

.. function:: MedianFilter(size=3)

    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a median filter of the given size. For each pixel in the input image, this filter copies the median pixel value from a (size, size) environment to the output image.

.. function:: MaxFilter(size=3)

    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a max filter of the given size. For each pixel in the input image, this filter copies the largest pixel value from a (size, size) environment to the output image.

.. function:: ModeFilter(size=3)
    
    (New in 1.1.5) Creates a mode filter of the given size. For each pixel in the input image, this filter copies the most common pixel value in a (size, size) environment to the output image. If no pixel value occurs more than once, the original pixel value is used.
