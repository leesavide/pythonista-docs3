The :mod:`webbrowser` module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying
Web-based documents to users. Under most circumstances, simply calling the
:func:`.open` function from this module will do the right thing.

**Please note:** Pythonista uses a custom version of this module that only
supports the :func:`open` function. The behavior is different from other
platforms in that web pages are opened in an embedded browser view within
the app for `http(s)` and `file` URLs. For custom URL schemes that are
registered by an app (e.g. `mailto:`), the registered app is opened. This also
works for third-party apps.


.. function:: open(url[, modal=False, stop_when_done=False])

   Display *url* in an in-app browser, if the scheme of the URL is `http`,
   `https` or `file`. Using other URL schemes can be used to open native
   apps that are registered for these schemes.
   
   If you want to open http or https URLs in Safari instead of the built-in
   browser, you can replace http(s) with safari-http(s) in your URL, e.g.
   'safari-http://google.com'.
   
   If the URL is valid (regardless of if it could actually be loaded by the
   browser) `True` is returned, otherwise `False`.
   
   The `modal` parameter controls whether the function should block until
   the `Done` button is tapped in the browser. It defaults to `False`.
   When this function is used to open an external app, the parameter is ignored.
   
   If the `stop_when_done` parameter is set to `True`, tapping the `Done` button
   automatically stops the script.

.. function:: can_open(url)

   .. warning::
       This function is deprecated and should not be used. For backwards-compatibility reasons, it will return `True` for any well-formed URL, regardless of whether an app is installed that can handle it. This change was necessary because of privacy-related changes in iOS 9.

.. function:: add_to_reading_list(url, [title, preview_text])

   Add a given URL with optional title and preview text to Safari's `Reading List`.
   
   Only http and https URLs are supported.
