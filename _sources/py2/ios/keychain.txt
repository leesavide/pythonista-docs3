:mod:`keychain` --- Secure Password Storage
======================================================

The :mod:`keychain` module provides simple access to secure password storage.

Please note that the keychain is not shared between apps, so you (fortunately)
cannot use this to access passwords that are stored in Safari's keychain, for
example.
