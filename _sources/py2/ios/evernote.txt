.. module:: evernote
   :synopsis: The Evernote Python SDK
.. sectionauthor:: Ole Zorn


This SDK contains wrapper code used to call the Evernote Cloud API from Python.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to run the client client sample code, you need a developer token. Get one at https://www.evernote.com/api/DeveloperToken.action

Example
--------

Here is a basic example of how you can use the evernote module to create a new note in your default notebook::

   auth_token = "YOUR_DEVELOPER_TOKEN"
   
   import evernote.edam.userstore.constants as UserStoreConstants
   import evernote.edam.type.ttypes as Types
   from evernote.api.client import EvernoteClient
   
   client = EvernoteClient(token=auth_token, sandbox=False)
   note_store = client.get_note_store()
   
   # List all of the notebooks in the user's account
   notebooks = note_store.listNotebooks()
   print "Found ", len(notebooks), " notebooks:"
   for notebook in notebooks:
      print "  * ", notebook.name
   print "Creating a new note in the default notebook"
   
   # To create a new note, simply create a new Note object and fill in
   # attributes such as the note's title.
   note = Types.Note()
   note.title = "Hello"
   
   note.content = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>'
   note.content += '<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM ' \
      '"http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">'
   note.content += '<en-note>Test Note<br/>'
   note.content += '</en-note>'
   
   # Finally, send the new note to Evernote using the createNote method
   # The new Note object that is returned will contain server-generated
   # attributes such as the new note's unique GUID.
   created_note = note_store.createNote(note)

   print "Successfully created a new note with GUID: ", created_note.guid
