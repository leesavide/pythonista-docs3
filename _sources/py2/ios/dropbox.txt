Creating an Application
-----------------------

You need to create an Dropbox Application to make API requests.

- Go to https://dropbox.com/developers/apps.

Obtaining an Access Token

All requests need to be made with an OAuth 2 access token. To get started, once
you've created an app, you can go to the app's console and generate an access
token for your own Dropbox account.
